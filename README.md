# silverstripe-theme v2
## to install 
download zip file (or fork) 
do not `clone`, since this is just a bootstrap and must be developed.
rename `silverstripe-theme` to `your-name`, then
set its name in `mysite/_config/config.yml` (replace 'simple' with 'your-name').
Next `flush=1` your site and your empty theme is switched on.
## gulp task
in theme folder run once `npm install` or `sudo npm install` then `gulp `
This adds watcher for .SS, js, scss, css, images files, that will compile scss (if needed) and reload page.
