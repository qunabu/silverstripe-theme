# silverstripe-theme
## to install 
download zip file (or fork) 
do not clone, since this is just a bootstrap and must be developed 
rename `silverstripe-theme` to `your-name`
set in `mysite/_config/config.yml` name of your theme (replace 'simple')
`flush=1` your site and your empty theme is switched 
## grunt task
in theme folder run once `npm install` or `sudo npm install` then `grunt watch`
This adds watcher for .SS, js, scss, css, images files, that will compile scss (if needed) and reload page.

:shit:
